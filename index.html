            <p> Hi! I'm currently a SETI at Google working on Cloud Networking offerings.
            I have experience in web development, devops, and QA, and I have previously interned at Mozilla and Illumio. I will be starting work at Google as a Tools and Infrastructure Engineer on the Cloud Networking team this summer! In my free time I work on my deadlift and squats, run occasional half marathons, build mechanical keyboards, and play Monster Hunter. Resume available at request.

                These are some older projects that I've done in the past. Clicking the titles
                will take you to the repo of the project if available, and clicking the thumbnails
                will take you to demos of the projects as well.

                        My senior year fall semester I took a class on computational photography and image manipulation. Even though they were
                        class projects I still like to show them because the results from just a little bit of linear algebra still amaze me.
                        The above panorama was stitched together automatically by comparing similar images using corners as features then RANSAC to
                        find the appropriate transformation. (<a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa15/upload/files/proj7B/cs194-ab/">Project Link</a>) Projects were done in either Python or MatLab depending on the problem. Other projects include,
